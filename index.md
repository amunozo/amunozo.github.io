## Alberto Muñoz-Ortiz

Hi! I am Alberto, PhD student in Natural Language Processing at **Universidade da Coruña**, Spain, under the supervision of [David Vilares](http://www.grupolys.org/~david.vilares/) and [Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez](http://www.grupolys.org/~cgomezr/).

I am currently visiting [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/)'s [NLP Lab](https://nlp.epfl.ch/) in Lausanne, Switzerland, hosted by [Antoine Bosselut](https://atcbosselut.github.io/) until March 2024.

I enjoy exploring alternative approaches for low-resoure setups, using tools such as transfer learning, creation of synthetic data, grokking, or the use of linguistic information such as syntactic dependencies. Moreover, I am also interested in how large language models differ (or not) from humans on handling linguistic structures.

Previously, I was a visited researcher at [MaiNLP Research Lab](https://mainlp.github.io/), [Ludwig-Maximilians Universität](https://www.lmu.de/en/) in Munich, Germany, hosted by [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/) during Summer 2023. I studied the use of pixel-based approaches for multilingual language models together with Barbara and [Verena Blaschke].
